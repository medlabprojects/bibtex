abstract = {Cochlear implants must be inserted carefully to avoid damaging the delicate anatomical structures of the inner
ear. This has motivated several approaches to improve the safety and efficacy of electrode array insertion by
automating the process with specialized robotic or manual insertion tools. When such tools are used, they must
be positioned at the entry point to the cochlea and aligned with the desired entry vector. This paper presents an
image guidance system capable of accurately positioning a cochlear implant insertion tool. An optical tracking
system localizes the insertion tool in physical space while a graphical user interface incorporates this with patient-
specific anatomical data to provide error information to the surgeon in real-time. Guided by this interface, novice
users successfully aligned the tool with an mean accuracy of 0.31 mm.},
